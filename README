This is the first project due in CSC412, written by Adam Seyfarth and Russel
Gibson.

It is a framework for genetic programming.  That is, when combined with a
fitness evaluation function and a set of primitives + terminals, it can be
used to evolve a program that approximates the desired behavior.  The language
of the project is Common Lisp.

Two ideas for example behaviors to evolve are:
- A program that takes two real numbers and produces the distance of that
  point from the origin.
- A program that takes two integer coordinates and returns a value from 0 to
  255 representing lightness, which when run over a range of x and y will draw
  a monochromatic picture of the moon (gray crescent in the middle, black
  elsewhere).
